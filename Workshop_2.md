## SETTING UP ARDUINO

Equipment Required: Arduino board and cable (provided) and windows/Mac OS X computer.

To start programming on the arduino board we must first download the software which can be found on this website [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### WINDOWS:
1.click the Windows to go to the download page

Note: If the application has a pop up warning just run the application :D

5. The application should look something like this and you're ready to start coding

## RUNNING CODE
Note: make sure check tools -> board and port

Basics on running code: Make sure the file is saved -> verify with the tick at the top left hand corner -> upload the code to the arduino which is the arrow pointing to the right (next to the tick).

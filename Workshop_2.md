Install homebrew by typing the following line in terminal: ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"```
    
Note: you may be asked to type your password.
    
Install the latest Python Interpreter by typing the following line terminal: ```brew install python```  
&nbsp;

4. Create a virtual environment.

Why? Virtual environments keep things tidy! It creates an isolated environment for your project so that th aksfjalksjf skfj / work in progress

Create a folder on your computer and call it "MYMI_Workshop_2"

**Windows:** Open Command Prompt or Powershell

**Mac:** Open Terminal

In terminal/command prompt/powershell, navigate to the folder that you created. In terminal or powershell type "ls" (use "dir" in command prompt) to see the folders in your current directory. Type "cd" followed by the folder name to move into a folder. You can hit tab to autocomplete folder names.

Type ```python3 -m venv .``` and hit enter to create the virtual environment. This should take less than 2 minutes.

6. Check that the Python Interpreter has installed properly 

**Windows:** Open Command Prompt or Powershell

**Mac:** Open Terminal

Type "python" then hit enter, the version number should be 3.8 or above. 

Type "exit()" then hit enter

### Mac OS
